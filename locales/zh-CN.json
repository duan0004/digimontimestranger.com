        "paragraph2": "However, if you value speed and tactical depth, Veemon offers incredible versatility. For players who prefer defensive playstyles, Guilmon's tankiness is unmatched.",
        "paragraph3": "Remember: your starter choice matters most for the first 10-15 hours of gameplay. By mid-game, you'll have access to dozens of powerful Digimon, so choose the starter that appeals to your personal playstyle and enjoy the journey!"
